# youtube_transcriber

- This script generates transcripts for YouTube videos. 
- It uses OpenAI's speech recognizer, Whisper, and runs in Google Colab. 
- I tested it with the freely available T4 GPU. 
  - It took about 40 minutes to produce the transcript for a 106-minute Hungarian video using the "large-v2" model.
